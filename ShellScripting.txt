------ Let's Start Shell Scripting -------

  Hardware <-> Kernel <-> Shell <-> Terminal <-> GUI <-> User


  Shell Scripting is a method to run multiple commands one by one automatically through a Shell Script Programm File (i.e fileName.sh ) 


  # we can create a ShellScript by using ` cat ` or ` touch ` commands.

      ->  $ cat >> NewFile.sh 

      ->  $ touch NewFile.sh


  # we can exicute this ShellScript file ( NewFile.sh ) by using ` sh ` command.

      -> $ sh NewFile.sh


  # to open any file in Vim Editor from Terminal We can use command ` vi fileName ` .

      -> $ vi NewFile.sh 


  # if we want to Write something in file from Vim Editor , then Press the key INSERT from keyboard.

      -> Press INSERT Key  --> Switch to Insert/Writing Mode.


  # if we want to save the content which we have written in this file from Vim Editor.

      -> Press ESC key   --> Exit from Insert/Writing Mode.

      -> Press ` : wq! ` --> this command will save the data and exit from Vim.

      -> Press ` : q `   --> this command will exit from the Vim ,But it will not save the Data into file , Here we can get data Loss.



  # ShellScripting  Language ::
       
      -> ` echo ` --> to print something In Terminal Screen.
          
                 echo Hello Friends

                 echo " Hello Friend's "
                 

      -> ` read ` --> this is used to take input from user in Terminal Screen.
              
                 echo " Enter your name : "
                 read name
                 echo Your Name is : $name 
           
           # Here we did not make/define any variable Earlier using the command `read `,So `read` command creates a new varible and assign the value which it takes as Input from user .

           # Here the Symbole ` $ ` is used to access the varible, i.e InterPretter can get to Know that it is a Variable or string.

      # to make variables in ShellScript , Just write the name of variable and assigin the value to it which we want.
                
                echo Enter your Name : 
                
                name=""

                read name
                echo Your Name is $name

            # Here we have created a variable firstly before using the ` read ` command and assign a initial value Empty as a String.

      # How to use ArithMatic Operators between two or more variables

                A=0
                B=0

                echo Enter the value of A : 
                read A 

                echo Enter the value of B :
                read B 

                echo Sum of A+B is : `expr $A + $B `

                echo Difference of A-B is : `expr $A - $B `

                echo Multiplication  of "A*B" is : `expr $A /* $B `

                echo Division  of A/B is : `expr $A / $B `

            # Here we have created Two variables initialy and assigin them a value 0. 
              After it user Enter the Values of A & B which updates the current value of Variable.

            # Here we uses `expr Operations `, that mean  ` ` indicates that we want to perform an Opetation, `expr ` indicates that expr --> expression_is    

            # Here Multiplication Operator is used as ` \* ` not like ` * `
